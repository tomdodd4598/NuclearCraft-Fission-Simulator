NuclearCraft Fission Simulator
=============================================


Summary
-------

A small program that will simulate the depletion and reprocessing of nuclear fuels and the decay hastening of fission resources. Use the xml files to configure the simulation parameters and all of the materials' stats, recipes and supply rates. You can also add your own fuels and resources - simply copy the format of the other materials!

You'll need the three xml files and the jar. If you are using Windows/Mac, you may want the batch/command file to run the program.
